                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                 <p>An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another.
                    The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earthâ€™s
                     surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above 
                      it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.</p>

                <h1>Major Earthquakes</h1>
                <p>Earthquakes are caused by movements within the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle. They range from events too weak to be detectable except by sensitive instrumentation, to sudden and violent events lasting many minutes which have caused some of the greatest disasters in human history.</p>
