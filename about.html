                <h1>What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?</h1>
                <p>The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. 
                The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.

                But this skin is not all in one piece â€“ it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth.
                 Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. 
                 We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. 
                 The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally,
                 when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.</p>

                <h1>How are earthquakes recorded?</h1>
                <p>Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. 
                    The recording they make is called a seismogram. 
                    The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free.
                     When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. 
                    The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded.</p>
